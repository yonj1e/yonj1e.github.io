#### Undo Logs

撤销(undo)日志子系统提供了一种存储有限时间内所需数据的方法。每当修改zheap关系时都会生成撤消数据，但只有在(1)提交或回滚生成的事务并且(2)没有可能需要它用于MVCC目的的快照时才会生成撤消数据。有关zheap的更多信息，请参见src/backend/access/zheap/README。撤消日志子系统涉及为有效回收和缓冲随机访问而优化的原始存储。

The undo log subsystem provides a way to store data that is needed for a limited time.  Undo data is generated whenever zheap relations are modified, but it is only useful until (1) the generating transaction is committed or rolled back and (2) there is no snapshot that might need it for MVCC purposes.  See src/backend/access/zheap/README for more information on zheap.  The undo log subsystem is concerned with raw storage optimized for efficient recycling and buffered random access.

与重做(redo)数据(WAL)一样，撤消数据由在64位地址空间内的位置标识的记录组成。与重做数据不同，寻址空间在内部划分为多个编号的日志。UndoRecPtr的前24位标识撤消日志编号，其余40位用于寻址该撤消日志中的空间。更高级别的代码(zheap)在很大程度上忽略了这种内部结构，主要处理不透明的UndoRecPtr值。

Like redo data (the WAL), undo data consists of records identified by their location within a 64 bit address space.  Unlike redo data, the addressing space is internally divided up unto multiple numbered logs. The first 24 bits of an UndoRecPtr identify the undo log number, and the remaining 40 bits address the space within that undo log.  Higher level code (zheap) is largely oblivious to this internal structure and deals mostly in opaque UndoRecPtr values.

使用多个撤消日志而不是单个统一空间可以避免单个插入点导致的争用，因为每个会话都可以单独访问将数据写入给定的撤消日志。它还允许并行空间回收。

Using multiple undo logs instead of a single uniform space avoids the contention that would result from a single insertion point, since each session can be given sole access to write data into a given undo log. It also allows for parallelized space reclamation.

与重做数据一样，撤消数据存储在磁盘上的编号段文件中，可根据需要进行回收。与重做数据不同，通过缓冲池访问撤消数据。在这方面，它类似于常规关系数据。缓冲区内容在检查点期间以及每当被驱逐以为其他页面腾出空间时写入磁盘。但是，与常规关系数据不同，撤消数据有可能永远不会被写入磁盘：如果页面被分配，然后在没有插入检查点的情况下被丢弃而没有内存压力引起的驱逐，则不会生成磁盘IO。

Like redo data, undo data is stored on disk in numbered segment files that are recycled as required.  Unlike redo data, undo data is accessed through the buffer pool.  In this respect it is similar to regular relation data.  Buffer content is written out to disk during checkpoints and whenever it is evicted to make space for another page. However, unlike regular relation data, undo data has a chance of never being written to disk at all: if a page is allocated and and then later discarded without an intervening checkpoint and without an eviction provoked by memory pressure, then no disk IO is generated.

保持撤销数据与重做数据在物理上是分开的，并通过现有的共享缓冲区机制访问它，以便为MVCC目的有效地访问它。

Keeping the undo data physically separate from redo data and accessing it though the existing shared buffers mechanism allows it to be accessed efficiently for MVCC purposes.

#### Meta-Data

在任何给定时间，存在的撤消日志集都在共享内存中跟踪，并且可以在pg_stat_undo_logs视图中进行检查。对于每个撤消日志，将跟踪一组称为撤消日志的元数据的属性：

At any given time the set of undo logs that exists is tracked in shared memory and can be inspected in the pg_stat_undo_logs view.  For each undo log, a set of properties called the undo log's meta-data are tracked:

* 保存其段文件的表空间
* the tablespace that holds its segment files
* 持久性级别(永久，未记录，临时)
* the persistence level (permanent, unlogged, temporary)
* “丢弃”指针; 此点之前的数据已被丢弃
* the "discard" pointer; data before this point has been discarded
* “插入”指针：此处将写入新数据
* the "insert" pointer: new data will be written here
* “结束”指针：此时将需要新的撤消段文件
* the "end" pointer: a new undo segment file will be needed at this point

三个指针discard、insert和end严格向前移动，直到整个撤消日志用尽为止。在任何时候都满足 discard<= insert <= end。当discard == insert时，撤消日志为空(之前插入的所有内容都已被丢弃)。当常规后端分配新空间时，插入指针前进，并且当撤消工作进程确定没有会话可能需要数据进行回滚或查找旧版本的元组以满足快照时，丢弃指针通常会前进。在某些特殊情况下，包括单用户模式和临时撤消日志，丢弃指针也可能由前台会话同步进行。

The three pointers discard, insert and end move strictly forwards until the whole undo log has been exhausted.  At all times discard <= insert <= end.  When discard == insert, the undo log is empty (everything that has ever been inserted has since been discarded). The insert pointer advances when regular backends allocate new space, and the discard pointer usually advances when an undo worker process determines that no session could need the data either for rollback or for finding old versions of tuples to satisfy a snapshot.  In some special cases including single-user mode and temporary undo logs the discard pointer might also be advanced synchronously by a foreground session.

为了在给定UndoRecPtr的情况下提供对撤消日志元数据的恒定时间访问，概念上存在由撤销日志编号索引的UndoLogControl对象的数组。由于该数组太大，并且由于我们期望活动的撤销日志编号很小并且是群集的，因此我们一次只在内存中保留该逻辑数组的小范围。我们使用撤销日志编号的高阶位来识别“bank”(数组片段)，然后使用低阶位来识别bank中的插槽。每个bank都有一个DSM段支持。我们希望任何时候都只需要1或2个这样的DSM段。

In order to provide constant time access to undo log meta-data given an UndoRecPtr, there is conceptually an array of UndoLogControl objects indexed by undo log number.  Since that array would be too large and since we expect the set of active undo log numbers to be small and clustered, we only keep small ranges of that logical array in memory at a time.  We use the higher order bits of the undo log number to identify a 'bank' (array fragment), and then the lower order bits to identify a slot within the bank.  Each bank is backed by a DSM segment.  We expect to need just 1 or 2 such DSM segments to exist at any time.

所有撤消日志的元数据都会在每个检查点写入磁盘。它存储在PGDATA/pg_undo /下的文件中，使用检查点的重做点(WAL LSN)作为其文件名。在启动时，重做点的文件可用于从重做点到共享内存的那一刻恢复所有撤消日志的元数据。对丢弃指针和结束指针的更改由undolog.c进行WAL记录，并且在崩溃后恢复时将使内存中的元数据更新。插入指针的更改包含在其他WAL记录中(见下文)。

The meta-data for all undo logs is written to disk at every checkpoint.  It is stored in files under PGDATA/pg_undo/, using the checkpoint's redo point (a WAL LSN) as its filename.  At startup time, the redo point's file can be used to restore all undo logs' meta-data as of the moment of the redo point into shared memory.  Changes to the discard pointer and end pointer are WAL-logged by undolog.c and will bring the in-memory meta-data up to date in the event of recovery after a crash.  Changes to insert pointers are included in other WAL records (see below).

创建、删除和回收撤消日志段文件以及WAL记录相关的元数据更改的责任在src/backend/storage/undo/undolog.c。

Responsibility for creating, deleting and recycling undo log segment files and WAL logging the associated meta-data changes lies with src/backend/storage/undo/undolog.c.

#### Persistence Levels and Tablespaces

当客户端代码请求新的撤消日志空间时，正在修改的关系的持久性级别和GUC “undo_tablespaces”的当前值控制选择哪个撤消日志。如果会话已经附加到合适的撤消日志并且它没有耗尽地址空间，则可以立即使用它。否则，必须找到或创建合适的撤消日志。系统应该稳定在每个活动写入后端的一个撤消日志上(如果使用不同的表空间是持久性级别，则使用更多撤销日志)。

When new undo log space is requested by client code, the persistence level of the relation being modified and the current value of the GUC "undo_tablespaces" controls which undo log is selected.  If the session is already attached to a suitable undo log and it hasn't run out of address space, it can be used immediately.  Otherwise a suitable undo log must be either found or created.  The system should stabilize on one undo log per active writing backend (or more if different tablespaces are persistence levels are used).

修改未记录的关系时，操作生成的撤消数据必须存储在未记录的撤消日志中。这会导致在从非关闭检查点恢复期间删除撤消数据以及所有未记录的关系。同样，临时关系需要特殊处理：它们的缓冲区是后端本地的，并且其他后端(包括撤消工作者)无法访问它们。

When an unlogged relation is modified, undo data generated by the operation must be stored in an unlogged undo log.  This causes the undo data to be deleted along with all unlogged relations during recovery from a non-shutdown checkpoint.  Likewise, temporary relations require special treatment: their buffers are backend-local and they cannot be accessed by other backend including undo workers.

表空间中的非空撤消日志会阻止删除表空间。

Non-empty undo logs in a tablespace prevent the tablespace from being dropped.

#### Undo Log Contents

撤消日志内容在PGDATA/base/undo/或PGDATA/pg_tblspc/VERSION/undo/下的1MB段文件中，文件名对其第一个字节的地址(UndoRecPtr)进行编码。'.' 将撤消日志编号部分与偏移部分分离，以供管理员使用。

Undo log contents are written into 1MB segment files under PGDATA/base/undo/ or PGDATA/pg_tblspc/VERSION/undo/ using filenames that encode the address (UndoRecPtr) of their first byte.  A period '.'  separates the undo log number part from the offset part, for the benefit of human administrators.

撤消日志是面向页面的，并使用常规的PosgreSQL页眉，包括校验和(如果启用)和LSN。UndoRecPtr可用于获取缓冲区内的缓冲区和偏移量，然后应用常规缓冲区锁定和页面LSN规则。虽然通过询问给定数量的可用字节(不包括页眉)来分配空间，但客户端代码负责跨越页眉并前进到下一页。

Undo logs are page-oriented and use regular PosgreSQL page headers including checksums (if enabled) and LSNs.  An UndoRecPtr can be used to obtain a buffer and an offset within the buffer, and then regular buffer locking and page LSN rules apply.  While space is allocated by asking for a given number of usable bytes (not including page headers), client code is responsible for stepping over the page headers and advancing to the next page.

WAL日志记录撤销日志内容的责任在于客户端代码(即zheap)。虽然undolog.c WAL-记录除插入点和检查点之外的所有元数据更改，但客户端代码负责在恢复时以相同顺序分配撤消日志空间。这样就不必为每次插入撤销日志而明确地和单独地对插入点进行WAL记录，从而大大减少了WAL流量。(只要超过1MB的段边界，WAL仍然由undolog.c生成，因为这也会使结束指针前进。)

Responsibility for WAL-logging the contents of the undo log lies with client code (ie zheap).  While undolog.c WAL-logs all meta-data changes except insert points and checkpoints all meta-data including insert points, client code is responsible for allocating undo log space in the same sequence at recovery time.  This avoids having to WAL-log insertion points explicitly and separately for every insertion into an undo log, greatly reducing WAL traffic.  (WAL is still generated by undolog.c whenever a 1MB segment boundary is crossed, since that also advances the end pointer.)

这种隐式插入指针移动方案的一个复杂之处是，恢复不能自然地访问事务和撤消日志之间的关联。也就是说，虽然'do'会话具有当前附加的撤销日志，它们从中分配新空间，但恢复是由单个启动过程执行的，该过程没有生成正在重放的WAL的会话的概念。因此，在恢复时维护xid-> undo log number map。在'do'时，在给定事务中使用任何永久撤消日志时首次发出WAL记录，以便可以在重做时恢复映射。这允许将分配流定向到适当的撤销日志，以便可以生成相同的结果撤销日志指针流。(未记录和临时撤消日志没有此问题，因为它们在恢复时未使用。)

One complication of this scheme for implicit insert pointer movement is that recovery doesn't naturally have access to the association between transactions and undo logs.  That is, while 'do' sessions have a currently attached undo log from which they allocate new space, recovery is performed by a single startup process which has no concept of the sessions that generated the WAL it is replaying.  For that reason, an xid->undo log number map is maintained at recovery time. At 'do' time, a WAL record is emitted the first time any permanent undo log is used in a given transaction, so that the mapping can be recovered at redo time.  That allows a stream of allocations to be directed to the appropriate undo logs so that the same resulting stream of undo log pointer can be produced.  (Unlogged and temporary undo logs don't have this problem since they aren't used at recovery time.)

另一个复杂情况是，在从在线检查点恢复期间(崩溃或基本备份之后)，在pg_undo下编写的检查点文件可能包含不一致的数据。为了弥补这一点，客户端代码必须安排在插入可能导致恢复期间撤消日志访问的第一个WAL记录时记录撤消日志元数据记录。这在概念上类似于检查点之后的整页图像，但是每个检查点的每个撤消日志仅限于一个元数据WAL记录。

Another complication is that the checkpoint files written under pg_undo may contain inconsistent data during recovery from an online checkpoint (after a crash or base backup).  To compensate for this, client code must arrange to log an undo log meta-data record when inserting the first WAL record that might cause undo log access during recovery. This is conceptually similar to full page images after checkpoints, but limited to one meta-data WAL record per undo log per checkpoint.

src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c不知道是否存在undo log作为缓冲数据的单独类别。读取和写入缓冲的撤消日志页面由src/backend/storage/smgr/undo_file.c中的新存储管理器处理。有关更多详细信息，请参阅src/backend/storage/smgr/README。

src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c is unaware of the existence of undo log as a separate category of buffered data.  Reading and writing of buffered undo log pages is handled by a new storage manager in src/backend/storage/smgr/undo_file.c.  See src/backend/storage/smgr/README for more details.
